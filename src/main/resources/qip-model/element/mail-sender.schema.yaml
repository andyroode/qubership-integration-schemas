          For example, if you send emails in text/html format and want

          set the alternative mail body with this key as a header.

          Ignore unsupported charset in the local JVM when sending mails.
          If the charset is unsupported then charset=XXX (where XXX represents
          the unsupported charset) is removed from the content-type
          and it relies on the platform default instead.
